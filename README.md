# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! In this simple Java console application, you will try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The goal is to guess the number in the least amount of tries.

## How to Play

1. The program will welcome you and prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. You will make a guess, and the program will provide feedback if your guess is higher or lower than the randomly chosen number.
3. Based on the feedback, you continue to make guesses until you correctly guess the number.
4. After guessing correctly, the program will display the number of attempts you made.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `Main.java` file.
2. Compile and run the Java program in your preferred development environment.

## Code Overview

The code is structured into several methods to enhance readability and maintainability:

- **`welcome()`**: Displays a welcome message and instructions for the game.
- **`chooseNum()`**: Generates a random number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess.
- **`guessNum()`**: Takes user input for their guess.
- **`lowerOrHigher()`**: Checks if the user's guess is correct and provides feedback. The user continues guessing until the correct number is identified.
- **`statistics()`**: Displays the number of attempts made by the user.

## Usage

Run the `Main` class to start the Number Guessing Game. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your guesses and enjoy the challenge of guessing the correct number in the least number of attempts.
